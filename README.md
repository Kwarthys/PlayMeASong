Play Me A Song !

From 8bit signal generation to a full scale music band, this project aims at creating infinite random but coherent music.

First, i created an instrument from a couple of sin waves, making it something close to a flute to the ear. That flute plays random notes in a given scale.

Then i broke free of the sine waves and started using more complex instrument tone, with different envelopes. This allowed me to create a few instruments dedicated to specific frequency range, and drums. Then by combining the differents notes into patterns and bars, we get a coherent sound !

To go further, patterns can be slowly modified to maintain coherence, but add more complexity. Very often in music, a simple pattern is the base, and its variation will add depth to the whole piece. Here's an example of generation with the two lead voices (higher pitched) following a "ABACABAD" pattern.
